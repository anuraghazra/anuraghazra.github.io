(which is in my opinion is amazing)</p>\n<p>But knowing how vuejs internally works requires knowledge of AST, compilation, optimization, codegen etc etc. which in my opinion is not an easy task.\nAnd we haven't even talk about Reactivity in vuejs.</p>\n<p><strong>Now, let's talk about React.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If I ask someone</strong><br>\n\"How react works?\"<br>\n\"How conditional rendering works?\"  </p>\n<p>Well in case of react, the internals are far far more simpler than Vuejs.\nand yes modern react uses <code class=\"language-text\">JSX compilation</code> but you need to know how React.createElement works not how <code class=\"language-text\">compilation</code> works in order to understand how react works.</p>\n<p>React has a <code class=\"language-text\">React.createElement</code> method which takes 3 parameters (tagName, props, childrens) in order to create a virtual dom node. </p>\n<p>basically -></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-jsx line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">hello</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span> \n<span class=\"token comment\">// converts to</span>\nReact<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">createElement</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"p\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"hello\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Now with this simple factory function we can compose the whole virtual dom tree like this</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-jsx line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-jsx\">React<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">createElement</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'div'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> \n  <span class=\"token keyword\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  React<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">createElement</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'p'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"hello\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>After composing the dom tree ReactDOM.render will recursively mount the vdom to the actual dom.</p>\n<p>And that's basically it. and the cool thing is because Reactjs is just plain simple javascript it answers all the questions like</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How conditional rendering works.  </li>\n<li>How loops will be handled.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because React.createElement is just a function call you can just pass an array of childrens</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-jsx line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> arr <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">'one'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><span class=\"token string\">'two'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'three'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\nReact<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">createElement</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'div'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  arr<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">map</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">v</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> React<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">createElement</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'p'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> v<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal;
